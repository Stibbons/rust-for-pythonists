How to edit documentation ?

Simply:

- submit to me a Pullrequest (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

That's all. Once accepted, the official documentation will be automatically updated.


How is it done?
===============

This github project is linked to the Read my Doc service, which triggers a rebuild of the online
documentation when changes are merged.

A travis build is also triggered (I prefere the notification from travis-ci).
